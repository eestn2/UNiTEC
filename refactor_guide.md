**Concrete, actionable ideas** to refactor and improve readability and maintainability in this codebase:

---

### 1. **Centralize Responsive Logic**

- ✅ **Already done:** You have a `useWindowSize` hook.  
- **Action:** Ensure all components use this hook instead of duplicating resize logic.  
- **Tip:** Remove all `useEffect`/`useState` window resize code from components and use `useWindowSize` everywhere.

---

### 2. **Consolidate Job Offer Logic**

- ✅ **Already done:** You have a `useJobOffer` hook.
- **Action:**  
  - Use this hook in both `JobOffer` and `JobOfferFV` (full view) components.
  - If you need different behaviors (e.g., always expanded in FV), add a prop to the hook or component to control this.

---

### 3. **Consistent Responsive Component Interface**

- ✅ **Already done:** You have a `ResponsiveComponent` interface.
- **Action:**  
  - Ensure all UI components (e.g., `InputField`, `TextBox`, `AppWindow`, `Notification`) extend this interface for consistent props.
  - Document all props clearly.

---

### 4. **Utility Functions for Figma Translation**

- ✅ **Already done:** You have `TranslateFigmaCoords`.
- **Action:**  
  - Always use these utilities for sizing and spacing.
  - If you find repeated calculations (e.g., `TranslateFigmaCoords.translateFigmaX(20)`), consider creating constants or helper functions for common values.

---

### 5. **Component Structure and File Organization**

- **Action:**  
  - Group related components (e.g., all job offer components in `components/offers/`).
  - Keep hooks in `hooks/`, utilities in `global/function/`, and interfaces/types in a `types/` or `interfaces/` folder if it grows.

---

### 6. **Reduce Inline Styles**

- **Action:**  
  - Move repeated inline styles to CSS classes in index.css or component-specific CSS modules.
  - Use CSS variables for colors, spacing, and font sizes (already present in your CSS).

---

### 7. **Improve Documentation and Naming**

- **Action:**  
  - Ensure every component, hook, and utility has a clear JSDoc/TSDoc comment.
  - Use descriptive prop and variable names (avoid abbreviations unless standard).

---

### 8. **Reusable Form Components**

- **Action:**  
  - If you have repeated form layouts (e.g., registration forms), extract common field groups or layouts into reusable components (e.g., `UserFormFields`, `EnterpriseFormFields`).

---

### 9. **Error Handling and Loading States**

- **Action:**  
  - Standardize error and loading state handling in all components that fetch data (e.g., show a spinner or error message).
  - Consider a reusable `<Loading />` and `<ErrorMessage />` component.

---

### 10. **Testing and Type Safety**

- **Action:**  
  - Add unit tests for hooks and utilities.
  - Use TypeScript types everywhere, especially for API responses.
